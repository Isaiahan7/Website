            8/21-8/24 Week 1 - The class as a whole spent the first few days setting their AWS and github login. <br>
            There were some social interaction games in our groups, but most of the time was spent on ajusting the new technology resources.<br>
            We did an outside activity on the 24th of August. <br> 
            The outside activity was a marble track game where many of the students had to work together. <br>
            Using half cut tubes the group of students made a road for the marble. <br>
            The goal of the game was to move the marble into the bucket with only the few tubes given. <br>
            The teacher told the students to go inside the classroom before the bell rand and in the end none of the students were able to get the marble into the bucket. <br>
            
            8/29-8/31 Week 2 - In table group the students would work on drafting the design of the rubgburg machine.<br>
            First we started by being informed of the materials we would be able to use.
