            <center><h1>8/21-8/24 Week 1</h1></center><br>
            The class as a whole spent the first few days setting their AWS and github login. <br>
            There were some social interaction games in our groups, but most of the time was spent on ajusting the new technology resources.<br>
            We did an outside activity on the 24th of August. <br> 
            The outside activity was a marble track game where many of the students had to work together. <br>
            Using half cut tubes the group of students made a road for the marble. <br>
            The goal of the game was to move the marble into the bucket with only the few tubes given. <br>
            The teacher told the students to go inside the classroom before the bell rand and in the end none of the students were able to get the marble into the bucket. <br>
            <br><br>
            8/29-8/31 Week 2 - In table group the students would work on drafting the design of the root goldberg machine.<br>
            First we started by being informed of the materials we would be able to use.<br>
            Next we individually designed the rootgoldberg machine.<br>
            After finishing our individual designs we shared it with the other group mates, coming up with a combined project.<br>
            We designed a root goldberg machine for popping a balloon using different materials.<br>
            Although we had some complications in the 3d desinging website called TinkerCad, we were able to create a good draft of the final project.<br>
            On August 31st we had a test on the saftey slides. I was able to answer a few questions with ease, while some were a bit hard.<br>
            After working on the test we filled out a packet with a video on mechanical engineering.<br>
            <br><br>
            9/5 Week 3 - We finished the 3d design of the root goldberg machinein TinkerCad.<br>
            It was greatly improved and editted for the final production.<br>
