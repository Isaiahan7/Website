            8/21-8/24 Week 1 - The class as a whole spent the first few days setting their AWS and github login. <br>
            There were some social interaction games in our groups, but most of the time was spent on ajusting the new technology resources.<br>
            We did an outside activity on the 24th of August. <br> 
            The outside activity was a marble track game where many of the students had to work together. <br>
