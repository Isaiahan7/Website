            The class as a whole spent the first few days setting their AWS and github login.
            There were some social interaction games in our groups, but most of the time was spent on ajusting the new technology resources.
            We did an outside activity on the 24th of August.
            The outside activity was a marble track game where many of the students had to work together.
            Using half cut tubes the group of students made a road for the marble.
            The goal of the game was to move the marble into the bucket with only the few tubes given and cooperation.
            All the students ran to the back of the line to catch the marbles with the tubes to make new paths to prevent it from fall, but we failed multiple times. 
            When I was going to the back of the line to deliver the tube, someone's foot tripped me.
            The teacher told the students to go inside the classroom before the bell rand and in the end none of the students were able to get the marble into the bucket.
            I had to go to the nurses office to get bandages for my bleeding palm.<br>

            In table groups students would work on drafting the design of the rude goldberg machine.
            First we started by being informed of the materials we would be able to use for the final production.
            Next we individually designed the rude goldberg machine.
            After finishing our individual designs we shared it with the our group mates, coming up with a combined final draft of the project.
            The rude goldberg machine was designed for popping a balloon using different materials.
            Although we had some complications in the 3d desinging website called TinkerCad, we were able to create a good draft of the final project.
            On August 31st we had a test on the saftey slides.
            I was able to answer a few questions with ease, while some were a bit harder.
            After working on the test we filled out a packet by watching a video on mechanical engineering.
            The crash course video mentioned about how mechanical engineering is one of the oldest engineering subject ever used and how it was used to improve efficiency in the past.<br>

            <center><h1>9/5-9/7 Week 3</h1></center><br>
            We finished the 3d design of the rude goldberg machine in TinkerCad.
            It was greatly improved and editted for the final production.
            After turning it in the google classroom assignment we were instructed to work on our website.
            On September 7th, we got real world materials such as cardboard, box cutter, scissors, gorilla tape, and a hard board for cutting the cardboard.
            Our group made good progress and adapted to the new material building process.
            Using a pencil I drew out and cut the rectange base and wall shapes with some help from my group mates.
            Although there was some fooling around between some group mates, we were able to make almost one fourth of the project.
            We finished the inclined plane part of the project, whcih is tallest part of our build.<br>

            On Monday, we worked on the real world cardboard rude goldberg project some more.
            Although monday was a banking day(shorter period), we were able to make a little bit more progress, which is better than nothing.
            We were able to quickly finished because everyone cooperated quicker and better than usual.
            First we got the materials from the table on the left side of the room from monday and arranged it on our tables.
            We started by building another box that held the pulley.
            We built the pulley with layers of taped cardboard and string holding a box and wall.<br>

            We were able to have a longer time in building because September 12 was a regular long day.
            We were able to create the rest of the project build and test it out with a hot wheel car with a needle attached to it. 
            After activating the project with the baseball the pulley lifted up because of the weight of the baseball. 
            When the left side of the pulley was pushed down by the baseball, the right side which is the wall, was lifted up releasing the hot wheel borrowed from another classmate.
            We failed multiple times(around 3 times) and eventually found out the angle of the balloon prevented the needle from reaching the balloon properly.
            After rearanging certain things we managed to show our teacher the successful outcome of the machine. 
            We recorded a video of it and saved it to the website.
